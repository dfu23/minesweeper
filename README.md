# Minesweeper

Minesweeper was my first attempt at making (re-creating) a game. I have captured some of the different iterations over  the years. I will add more resources and information along the way.

## Notes On Game Logic

 * Dynamically creating a game board for a given size
 * Randomly placing mines on the board
 * Clearing an area of the board using recursion
 * User interaction and event handling

## Version Notes

 * 2003
   * HTML / CSS / JavaScript
   * Written with IE in mind (for example: the use of document.all)
   * Used images to show the different mine node states

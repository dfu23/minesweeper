minesweeper 2006
================

This was a port of the JavaScript version minesweeper to NeoSwiff. Essentially, NeoSwiff was a way to write a C# Windows Forms application that compiled into a Flash SWF file. A rather neat idea back in the mid 2000's.

A compiled version of the application is available under the bin/Releases since I don't think the NeoSwiff compiler is still available.

An interesting experiment would be to take this code and to try and see if it works/compiles as an actual Windows Forms application.
